# Robotics Project Team 1 Project - Salt with Pepper

## Overview

Welcome to our Robotics Project Team 1 Project - Salt with Pepper! This project creates an AI chatbot that helps GSU CS grad students quickly find answers from the graduation handbook using natural language processing and GPT technology.

## Team Members:

- **Boluwatife Owolabi**
- **Meghana Coca**
- **Bang Pham**
- **Sophie Nguyen**

## Problem Statement and Goal

### Problem Statement:

Graduate students in Georgia State University's Computer Science program often struggle to find specific information within long, complex graduation handbooks. Manually searching through these documents is time-consuming and inefficient.

### Goal:

Inspired by the capabilities of the Pepper robot, the goal of this project is to develop an AI chatbot capable of answering students' questions based on the content of the CS graduate handbook PDF file. The chatbot will leverage natural language processing to provide accurate and efficient responses.

## Key Features

- **Document-based Q&A:** Supports uploading PDF, DOCX, and TXT files, creating vector embeddings, and using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo to answer questions about uploaded documents.
- **Multi-thread Chat Interface:** Allows creating multiple chat threads, maintaining chat history, and navigating between different conversations with a custom blue-themed design.
- **Configurable Search Parameters:** Users can adjust chunk size and retrieval parameters, input their OpenAI API key, and customize document processing for more precise information retrieval.
- **Specialized Handbook Assistant:** Specifically designed to help users navigate and understand the GSU Computer Science Graduate Handbook through an interactive, AI-powered chatbot interface.

## Tech Stack:

- **Front End:** Streamlit, HTML & CSS
- **Back End:** Python
- **LLM Integration:** LangChain
- **PDF Parsing:** pypdf
- **LLM Models:** OpenAI GPT API integrated via `LangChain`
- **Storage:** chromadb
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- [GSU CS graduate handbook PDF file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KvNLtqjVvo0lc-GnyTFjyADFKE4Jiglb/view?usp=drive_link) for chatbot data.
