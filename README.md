# Robotics Project Team 1 Project - Salt with Pepper

## Overview

Welcome to our Robotics Project Team 1 Project - Salt with Pepper! This project creates an AI chatbot that helps GSU CS grad students quickly find answers from the graduation handbook using natural language processing and GPT technology.

## Team Members:

- **Boluwatife Owolabi**
- **Meghana Coca**
- **Bang Pham**
- **Sophie Nguyen**

## Problem Statement and Goal

### Problem Statement:

Graduate students in Georgia State University's Computer Science program often struggle to find specific information within long, complex graduation handbooks. Manually searching through these documents is time-consuming and inefficient.

### Goal:

Inspired by the capabilities of the Pepper robot, the goal of this project is to develop an AI chatbot capable of answering students' questions based on the content of the CS graduate handbook PDF file. The chatbot will leverage natural language processing to provide accurate and efficient responses.

## Key Features

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Requirements

### API & Libraries:

- **PDF Parsing:** `pdfminer`
- **LLM Models:** OpenAI GPT API integrated via `LangChain`

### Hosting & Storage:
